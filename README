Project for the University of Alabama in Huntsville's Association for Computing Machinery chapter's Hackathon for 2021

The purpose of this Project is to read data from the cdc.gov website and display the data in a meaningful way through the terminal

The Updater:
	updater.cpp contains an updateData function that pulls the new data.xml
	The new data file comes from https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36/data
	there is also a test file to test the updateData function, run "make updater_TEST" to build it

The Graph:
	graph.cpp contains a function to print the given data into a scatter plot graph
	there is also a test file to test the graph, run "make graph_TEST" to build it

The Data Array:
	DATA[d][t][s][a]
	t = 2, s = 10, a = 50
	setting t = 0 will get data, setting t = 1 will get the timestamp
	setting s 0-9 will determine what data is being looked at (ie. Total cases, new cases, etc.)
	setting a 0-49 will determine what state the data is from
	d is from 0-number_of_entries and is the specific data point being looked at
