Project for the University of Alabama in Huntsville's Association for Computing Machinery chapter's Hackathon for 2021

The purpose of this Linux project is to read data from the cdc.gov website and display the data in a meaningful way through the terminal

The Updater:
	updater.cpp contains an updateData function that pulls the new data.xml
	The new data file comes from https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36/data
	there is also a test file to test the updateData function, run "make updater_TEST" to build it and "make clean_updater_TEST" to clean the output

The Graph:
	graph.cpp contains a function to print the given data into a scatter plot graph
	there is also a test file to test the graph, run "make graph_TEST" to build it and "make clean_graph_TEST" to clean the output
