Project for the University of Alabama in Huntsville's Association for Computing Machinery chapter's Hackathon for 2021

The purpose of this Project is to read data from the cdc.gov website and display the data in a meaningful way through the terminal

The Updater:
	updater.cpp contains an updateData function that pulls the new data.xml
	The new data file comes from https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36/data
	there is also a test file to test the updateData function
